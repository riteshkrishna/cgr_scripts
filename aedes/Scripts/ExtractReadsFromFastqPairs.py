    # starts with a ##. The text next to ## indicates name of a SAM file that contains mapping information for the
    # reads of interest. The lines following ## list the read accessions that can be associated with the SAM mentioned
    # in the preceding ## line. SAM files are also categorised according to male and female. We want to extract FASTQ
    # records (both left read and right read) for each read and store the information in relevant male or female file.
    # In the end, we want four files - R1 and R2 for all male SAMs, and R1 and R2 for all female SAMs.
